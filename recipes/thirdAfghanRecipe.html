    <p>
        This baked ziti is always a hit! A lady I worked with brought this in one day, and everyone loved it. Now it is the favorite of all my dinner guests. I have made this also without the meat, and it is well received.

    <h2>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li class="steps">
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain.
        </li>
        <li class="steps">
            Meanwhile, brown ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li class="steps">
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.
        </li>
        <li class="steps">
            Spread 1/2 of the ziti in the bottom of the prepared dish; top with Provolone cheese, sour cream, 1/2 of the meat sauce, remaining ziti, mozzarella cheese, and remaining meat sauce. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li class="steps">
            Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheeses have melted, about 30 minutes.
